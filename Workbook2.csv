1	"In the example, the null hypothesis is that [____________]."	Gender is not associated with empathy	Gender is associated with empathy	Gender is not associated with empathy	Null Hypothesis <---> Nothing interesting will happen.
2	"In the compassionate rats example, the alternative hypothesis is that [____________]."	Gender is not associated with empathy	Gender is associated with empathy	Gender is associated with empathy	Null Hypothesis <---> Nothing interesting will happen.
3	The degrees of freedom for the test of independence is found by [____________].	row total*column total/sample size	(#rows - 1)*(#columns - 1)	(#rows - 1)*(#columns - 1)	Think about the definitions of degrees of freedom & expected count.
4	The expected count is found by [____________].	row total*column total/sample size	(#rows - 1)*(#columns - 1)	row total*column total/sample size	Think about the definitions of degrees of freedom & expected count.
5	[____________] is used to test if a specific model fits the data.	X^2 test for goodness of fit	X^2 test for independence	X^2 test for goodness of fit	At least two or more variables have to be present if we are testing for independence. An example of numerical variable would be age.
6	[____________] is used to examine if two categorical variables are associated.	X^2 test for goodness of fit	X^2 test for independence	X^2 test for independence	X^2 test for goodness-of-fit is adopted when there is only one variable involved. An example of numerical variable would be age.
7	A goodness of fit test of whether all categories of a variable are equally likely involves [____________]. 	one numerical variable	one nominal (categorical) variable	one nominal (categorical) variable	X^2 test for goodness-of-fit is adopted when there is only one variable involved. An example of numerical variable would be age.
8	X^2 test for independence is used when the variables of interest are [____________].	both numerical	both nominal (categorical)	both nominal (categorical)	At least two or more variables have to be present if we are testing for independence. An example of numerical variable would be age.
